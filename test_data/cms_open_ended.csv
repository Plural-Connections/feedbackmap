1) I have a TD child who is designated AIG and I think the IB program would be the right choice for her, however, is it at East Meck or Myers Park? Does Myers Park get their own IB program? That doesn't seem fair to me. We are assigned to MP right now but under 2 of these scenarios we would not be.

2) You ask in this survey to rank what is important but there were no questions about safety. That is probably my biggest concern. 
 
3) Do the SES data and enrollment projections include any assumptions for private school enrollment? After you remove the private school households from the South Meck data you are going to have a majority low SES school, while the neighboring HS's are sitting at over 70% high SES. How is this fair to the South Meck students? 

4) I searched the CMS website for the 20th day enrollment data and was unable to locate it. I don't feel like this deck presents a full picture because it doesn't give any SES data about Providence HS. I understand none of these plans make changes to Providence but when you are stripping the middle SES population from South Meck, it would be nice to see what you are not changing at Providence HS. 

5) My suggestion would be to make the relief school 100% magnet with multiple themes (IB, Performing Arts, STEM, Languages) with a 33% make-up of each SES status. Pull all the high SES kids from AK, Low SES kids from South Meck, and take the mid SES kids from all the schools. Otherwise South Meck is at a disadvantage because the wealthy families will leave for private and you will be left with majority low SES which is counter to CMS's goal.

We don't get the benefit of a new school aed we lose the IB program we sought to begin with when selecting our home schools.","We don't get to attend a new school so it's irrelevant.  I hope the kids that get moved there enjoy the benefits of a new facility, but moving kids from their current facility to another older facility should be minimized, especially when the enrollment numbers are down and OP is moving - Sharon does not need to make this change."

My neighborhood is at least 20 minutes from the high school The CMS data for OP to MPHS is incorrect. My children were twice split when progressing to a new school - elementary to middle and middle to high. This is also opposed to a CMS core value. CMS needs to walk their talk.","Very important","Very important","Very important","Moderately Important","Moderately Important","Moderately Important","Moderately Important","Not important","Moderately Important","1 (top choice)","2","3","Red provides better equity. However with AKHS and PHS having 0 to 2% poverty worst case is an abomination. None of these scenarios is fair, equitable, provides a school close to home or keeps feeder patterns intact. CMS needs to ditch all student assignments and start from scratch. PHS needs diversity, AKHS needs diversity, and SMHS needs to lose some of their poverty numbers to AKHS, which can surely absorb them.","The same as above. However I will add that Student Placement should adopt the Union County model and make students prove their address at school transitions - elementary to middle, middle to high. Also CMS should be hypervigilant with requiring all residency affidavits to be updated on a yearly basis. At this time CMS has no stomach for ensuring that students attend the correct schools. This is a huge issue, especially at AKHS where many students attend who live outside of the county, and the state. This costs CMS money annually but no one will speak to this issue. CMS needs to do better. ","Sending all of OP to Providence makes sense in that it reunites elementary school students in high school. It is the closest high school to the neighborhood by far, and the addition of the Swan's Run housing area would add much needed socio economic diversity to a school with 0 percent poverty. While the OPES students who go to Carmel will be split from their peers for high school, at least they will be reunited with their elementary school peers. Also, when looking at South Meck numbers the district should consider that the very high income neighborhoods surrounding Quail Hollow Country Club do not traditionally attend public schools. I don't think the answer it to ask OPES families to travel even farther for high school than they currently do. South Meck is farther from this area that PHS or MPHS (or EMHS is you want to get really specific.) I know that SMH needs to increase their higher income numbers but that could be accomplished without asking OPES parents to drive even farther to school.","Returning the IB program to MPHS could ease some of the overcrowding at other schools. This program was once very rigorous and well respected. They have the staff in place to support the magnet seats there. ","No concerns about the new school. ","AK needs relief. My greatest hope is that this school will adequately provide for that and that the redistricting plan is made knowing that AK will continue to grow. AK needs to get the most relief possible. A plan that doesn't address this fails."

Any break in this feeder pattern would be a negative for this factor of the matrix and for the kids that spent their early years together.

In Brown C, 3 of the 4 schools are brought to 100% or less for utilization. The only reason that Myers Park is not shown as under 100% is basing attendance at 3,000 when the current class room configuration, not including mobile classrooms, allows for more.

While Carmel is our assigned middle school, Randolph IB has provided an opportunity for my children to transition into an IB curriculum.  Myers Park has been a great experience so far for my 10th grader who has been finishing his IB MYP that he began at Randolph and will continue in the diploma program next year in 11th grade.  The opportunity to continue IB at Myers Park while rejoining friends from  elementary has been beneficial for my high schooler who along with many, were unable to see peers during remote learning. ","Very important","Very important","Moderately Important","Not important","Moderately Important","Moderately Important","Very important","Not important","Moderately Important","3","2","1 (top choice)","Brown C is the best option for keeping Sharon/Carmel at Myers Park- and follows the guiding principles for student assignment-1. Home to school distance- MP is the closest school for the majority of the students in the Sharon/Carmel zone. 2. It keeps intact feeder patterns- elementary schools are the building blocks of student assignment- this means all of Sharon should stay at Myers Park- 3.  I looking at SES there is very little difference in how these scenarios change the SES ","This choice separates the Sharon/ Carmel students from MP.  It will increase home to school distances, break up intact feeder patterns, make no noticeable change to SES, and needlessly move a percentage of students to a new feeder patterns which just results in a flip flop from MP to South Meck- not making the case for uprooting a small percentage of students who could instead remain with their intact feeder pattern","Continuity of those students assigned to Carmel but attending Randolph IB with the intention of continuing in IB at Myers Park has not been addressed.  If these students are moved, the assumption is they could continue at East Meck, however, that program will already be filled with students assigned to East Meck so it is not a valid solution or has not been explained as one. ","It is my understanding that during this process over the last few years, the capacity listed for schools has changed. While the charts in April showed Myers Park capacity was 3500, that number has been changed to 3000.  The charts no longer show the number of classrooms (which is 140 at Myers Park, not including the mobile classrooms) the fact that capacity is a moving target calls the validity of overcapacity percentages into question.  Based on 25 students per classroom, a capacity of 3000 would only use 120 of the 140 classrooms.  20 extra classrooms leaves plenty of room for the student from Sharon/Carmel.  Artificially lowering capacity at some schools makes it seem like schools are more overcrowded leading to asking for more bond money for new schools.  It will be hard to support the 2023 bond if CMS is not using the classrooms they already have.","How this will impact my/my child's/my students' academic trajectory.;How this will impact my/my child's/my students' athletic opportunities.;The social impacts on students (e.g. breaking up friend groups, having to start at a new school).;The students have had to work extremely hard the past year after remote learning.

While there has been considerable talk about the feeder patterns of Elementary to High School and Middle to High School, it is specifically stated in the decision matrix that ""elementary attendance areas kept intact” is the factor. Sharon Elementary is currently an intact feeder to Myers Park High School. Any break in this feeder pattern would be a negative for this factor of the matrix and for the kids that spent their early years together. When comparing the utilization of the the three maps, it is Brown C that does the most for lowering the percentage at the most schools.  In Brown C, 3 of the 4 schools are brought to 100% or less for utilization. The only reason that Myers Park is not shown as under 100% is basing attendance at 3,000 when the current class room configuration, not including mobile classrooms, allows for more. Red A only takes 2 schools to 100% or less and Brown A only a single school, the relief school,  accomplishes the goal.  ","Please plan carefully for the transitions for the students, especially for those who will be in high school at the time of the change. At a minimum juniors, along with the seniors already exempted, should be exempt from the redistricting decision and the board give them the option of attending the new school or remaining at their current school. The junior year is an important year as they plan for their college applications with letters of recommendations and extracurricular activities. They have spent two years establishing relationships in classrooms, clubs, sports, and after school activities. They should be allowed to continue on the academic pathway they have worked on for two years, be it the MYP to IB program or a CTE pathway. They will also miss out on leadership positions at the new schools as these positions are traditionally filled at the end of their sophomore year.  These students have already faced disruptions to their social relationships, sports, and academics due to the pandemic.

Also, the Transition statement above implies all students will be moving to a new school with unlimited opportunity when in fact the plans are simply shifting the majority of students from their existing school to another existing school with existing clubs, teams, vision, and culture which are unlikely to provide migrating students the opportunities described, especially seniors. Instead, the move will isolate students and disrupt their pursuits. Will a senior on newspaper staff that’s worked three years to be editor be offered the same opportunity shifting to a new school?

","Very important","Very important","Moderately Important","Very important","Moderately Important","Very important","Very important","Not important","Very important","","","1 (top choice)","This is the only scenario that adheres most closely to the 4 CMS principles for student assignment. It is the shortest home to school distance. It keeps elementary to high school feeder patterns in-tact. There is not a significant change in SES of the two high schools by moving the Sharon-Carmel students. Given significant trends in decreasing enrollment at Sharon and the fact that many existing classrooms are not being included in the presentation utilization numbers for MPHS, it makes sense to keep Sharon-Carmel at MP. ","I did not choose between Red A and Brown A as my bottom choice because both scenarios move Sharon-Carmel away from Myers Park. The differences in those two maps are related to the southern most schools and I think it's not right for me to have input on those outcomes as I am not informed and am not affected. I do not support any scenarios that does not keep Sharon Elementary in tact going to Myers Park HS. For the reasons stated above, there is not a compelling enough argument to disrupt communities by moving us. To make such a change needs to to yield a significant improvement somewhere and I do not see that happening (for the families of MPHS or SMHS). The reasons I stated above for keeping all Sharon students at MP:  It is the shortest home to school distance. It keeps elementary to high school feeder patterns in-tact. There is not a significant change in SES status of the two high schools by moving the Sharon-Carmel students. Given significant trends in decreasing enrollment at Sharon and the fact that many existing classrooms are not being included in the presentation utilization numbers for MPHS, it makes sense to keep Sharon-Carmel at MP.  ","I do not think this can be undertaken at this time, but what is desperately needed is an over haul of all the boundaries in order to create in-tact Elementary to Middle to High School feeder patters. I think this should be done, BEFORE looking at simply shuffling students between MPHS and South Meck. The boundaries for Sharon to AG and Sharon to Carmel only make sense if you look at them in the context of historical deal making. Sharon Woods goes to Sharon-AG-MP, but is much closer to Beverly Woods. Families who live less than a mile and clearly within walking distance of Carmel Middle are assigned to AG. Drawing the line for Carmel Middle assignment v. AG using Carmel Road makes absolutely no sense in terms of school to home distance. While it may ""technically"" not divide neighborhoods, it does in practice as these kids live and play together in elementary school at Sharon and at home as they can walk/bike to each other's houses. ","1. I'm confused by the utilization numbers for MPHS in the charts in the presentation. My understanding is there are 140 available classrooms there, but it looks like these are not being used for calculations. Please clarify if you are running capacity and utilization based on the number of classrooms in the school, the number of classrooms + mobile classrooms at the school, or something else?  The field that shows that information has been removed from the slides compared to earlier versions. More transparency on this calculation is needed. 

2. While I'm grateful for the opportunity to provide feedback, I worry there are some unintended consequences of having people essentially ""vote"" on these scenarios as oppose to simply providing structured feedback. It allows some people to organize ""against"" others. It also makes me choose support for a plan that affects my neighborhood through the Sharon-Carmel-MP reassignment (or not) but that also has scenarios about the more southern schools and I am not informed about those and do not want to offer opinions about what is best for those students without better context. Unfortunately, as individuals we don't have the time or capacity to do all the homework. 
CMS and the Board have incredibly difficult job of reassessing school assignment. I want to acknowledge how difficult this work is. And I want to acknowledge that a lot of effort has been put into gathering feedback from stakeholders after the April 2022 meeting. However I'm concerned that the format of these surveys and relying on the ""voting on maps"" has the opportunity to really skew what stakeholders really think and want. Please look at these results in the context of who is ""voting"".

The data in the slide presentation in November referenced 2019 data.  So much more to that piece that has been discovered by looking at records on who is holding the undeveloped land that will ultimately affect South Meck and the new high school that hasn't really been looked into, I am afraid.  The data regarding the students vs classrooms vs trailers (the trailers plans need to be included or not and noted why not on the slide with an *) .  If they aren't considering trailers in the numbers, are they going to be removing them?  If not, then why can't they be used?  The feeder pattern for OP - S Charlotte/Carmel - Providence needs to be fixed now while there is a chance.  It has been broken too long.  No reason to separate these kids.  Finally -the plans have to be sensitive to the fact that we will have YOUNG inexperienced drivers making a commute that is FAR more challenging in the dark at 6:45 am.  In addition, if you view 'as the crow flies' it is 3.2 miles to South Meck, but the safest way to get to South Meck from Olde Providence is +6 miles.  MPHS is one turn and a straight shot down Colony.  OR even closer still 1-2 miles to Providence.  Ultimately I am for the kids that are there being grandfathered in because after the pandemic and all that they have been through to have to RE-start high school after 1 year or 2 years, it is ridiculous.  The most stressful thing in life is making a job change, moving, etc.  It is basically both of those to students that have already been through so much. ","The new school is not an option for me. Moving my Sophomore and Junior after they have played sports, joined clubs and gotten through the awkwardness of Freshman year to have to re-start that, having gone through a pandemic where social awkwardness has taken its mental health toll on these children.

People moving to CLT are looking for overall CMS quality and safe neighborhoods. So if we solve for overall CMS success and long term focus vs loud voices, feeder pattern preferences etc, the decision would feel like a sound one. The discussions about the Relief high school boundaries are emotionally charged because parents are probably operating on the underlying premise that ABC school is 'good' and XYZ school isn't. This is a great opportunity to have student voices from each of the high schools talking about their experiences. (Maybe do some cool videos on FB or other social media?). As an example, if there were several SM students talking about how they love SM, then parents who were set on MP, might revise their assumptions.

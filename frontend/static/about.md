### Privacy Policy
Feedback Map is committed to preserving the privacy and confidentiality of its users and the data they use the tool to analyze.  Below are some details on how it seeks to achieve this.

#### Data Collection and Usage
Feedback Map does not save a copy of users' uploaded CSV or use it for any purposes beyond supporting their exploration of it.  However, Feedback Map does collect data on how users use the tool.  These collected fields include:

- Clicks and other engagement with the tool
- Time spent engaging with the tool

<br/>
At no point does Feedback Map request personally-identifiable information from users. All collected data will be retained indefinitely, even after users complete their use of the tool.  All data collected by Feedback Map is for the purposes of better-understanding usage patterns in order to inform product improvements.  It may also, in the future, help inform academic research exploring how to design effective civic technologies and other community engagement tools to support progress on matters of local relevance and importance.  Any such research may be published in a wide range of academic and/or mainstream media outlets. All findings will present aggregate and anonymous results.  Users are invited to email [hello@pluralconnections.org](mailto:hello@pluralconnections.org) at any point with questions about research or other findings.   

#### Data Ownership and Sharing
Feedback Map uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the application.  Parts of the application are powered by large language models developed and hosted by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).  To use these models, Feedback Map sends API requests to OpenAI that contain data from tge surveys uploaded by users.  As such, Feedback Map users are cautioned against uploading sensitive data with names, contact information, or other personally-identifiable information.  Users are also encouraged to read more about OpenAI's data and privacy policies on their website.  Although Feedback Map owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Feedback Map application, users retain all rights to their data. Beyond these third-party services used to maintain data, Feedback Map will never share user data with anyone outside of the team of developers.  Any engagement data shared with academic researchers will require prior approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB). 

#### Changes to Privacy Policy
Feedback Map may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at its sole discretion. Feedback Map encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Users' continued use of this tool after any changes in this Privacy Policy will constitute acceptance of these changes.
